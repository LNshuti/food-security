# African food production and trade

The purpose of this repo is to visualize the sources of food production and consumption in Africa. We identify reliable data sources to study trends in food production, imports, and exports for African countries as a whole and for a few countries of interest. Bref, we hope to answer the following two questions: 

**1. Where does our food come from?**
**2. How can we grow more of it?**
